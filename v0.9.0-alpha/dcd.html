<h1>DCD (Delta Channel Depletion)<a class="headerlink" href="#dcd-delta-channel-depletion" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Delta Channel Depletion (DCD) is an extension of DETAW to estimate daily channel depletions, including diversions, drainages, and seepages of the Delta islands. DCD also distributes these estimates for other model inputs such as DSM2, SCHISM, and CalSIM.</p>
<p>This version of DCD is based on the previous version of DCD from DETAW-DCD, but it is totally rewritten in Python. The algorithms in and the calibration of the previous version DCD are described in an annual report chapter, <a class="reference external" href="https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dcd/resource/24890484-11a6-4ada-a61a-3d1f7fdd948e">Calibrating and Validating Delta Channel Depletion Estimates</a>, and they are the same in the current version. The changes in the current DCD in DeltaCD are described in Chapter 3, Updating DETAW-DCD to DeltaCD, of <a class="reference external" href="https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/methodology-for-flow-and-salinity-estimates-in-the-sacramento-san-joaquin-delta-and-suisun-marsh/resource/dcabdb20-e638-4cf5-b199-78e78f0d482f">our 2023 annual report</a>.</p>

<h2>Main input file<a class="headerlink" href="#main-input-file" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main input file of DCD follows YAML format, just like DETAW. The following is an example of the DCD main input file. Currently, the parameters in the main input file keep the names from the previous DETAW-DCD. Note that some of the options are not well maintained, and they are subject to change.</p>
