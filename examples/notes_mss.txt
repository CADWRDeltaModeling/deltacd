For the base case, the drainage factors already incorporated the changes suggested by the Chapter 5 of the DWR Annual report (2023). 
For MSS, additional changes were made compared to the base case. 

1. The diversion factors were modified from the base case using coefficients recorded in the the Chapter 5 of the DWR Annual report (2023). The new file that reflects this change is diversion_factors_dsm2_mss.csv

2. For Old River, islands 31 and 41, irrigation effeciency was reduced from 80% to 60%, evapotranspiration was increased by 20%, ground water contribution was revised to be zero. The new files that reflect these changes are:
	gwrates_dsm2_mss.csv
	irrigation_efficiencies_dsm2_mss1.csv
 	Percentage_mss1.csv

3. For Pescadero, islands 65 and 66:
	scenario 1(_mss1): reduce ground water contribution to zero (it was 0.35 for island 65 and 0 for island 66):
		gwrates_dsm2_mss.csv
	scenario 2(_mss2): scenario 1 + irrigation effeciency is reduced from 80% to 60%, evapotranspiration increased by 20%. 
		irrigation_efficiencies_dsm2_mss2.csv
		Percentage_mss2.csv
We kept both mss1 and mss2 scenarios, since both fell in the reasonable observed flow range for Paradise Cut (see Chapter 5 of the DWR Annaul report, 2023).
